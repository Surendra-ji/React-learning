        notes: 'Banaras Hindu University Libraries is one of the largest University Library System in India. It germinated more than a century ago from a small but precious collection donated by Prof. P.K. Telang in the memory of his father Justice K.T. Telang in 1917 and housed in the Telang Hall of the Central Hindu College, Kamachha. It was nurtured in its infancy by the renowned historian Sir Jadunath Sarkar as first University Librarian.'
